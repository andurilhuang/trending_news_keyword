## Organization Overview
PitchBook Data, Inc is a web-based financial data and software company that delivers data, research and technology covering the private capital markets, including venture capital, private equity and M&A transactions. The company’s core product is the PitchBook Platform, which is a subscription-only database that provides data and insights to help professionals in venture capital, private equity fund, investment banks and law firms understand the investment market and make decisions. Within the PitchBook Platform, users can also use a variety of software and analysis tools to run targeted searches, build financial models, create data visualizations, and build custom benchmarks. It also provides commentary and analysis of current events, trends and issues relevant to its field through PitchBook News and Analysis. 

## Project Overview
PitchBook has access to numerous sources of news articles and content. The sponsor associates these articles with firms and people using Machine Learning processes. The sponsor sees news as a potential indicator of change within a firm, sector, or market. 
Within a news article, keywords can help to identify the related entities and purpose of the article. These keywords would also be used to understand how topics or entities are “trending”. The next step would be to categorize the sentiment and other article attributes and then present the information to users in a format which generates interest and discovery.
